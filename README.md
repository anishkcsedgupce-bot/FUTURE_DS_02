## Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze customer data to identify churn patterns, understand key retention drivers, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention for a subscription-based business.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes customer subscription information such as customer ID, tenure, contract type, monthly charges, total charges, and churn status.

## Analysis Performed

- Analyzed churn based on contract type, tenure, and monthly charges
- Identified high-risk customer segments contributing to churn
- Created visualizations to highlight churn trends and retention patterns

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn rate
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
- Higher monthly charges contribute to increased churn risk
- Customers on long-term contracts show better retention

## Recommendations
